# SmartBlocker
A Chrome extension that blocks ads. This extension still
under development, meaning not all ads may be blocked. 

# What needs work
Currently, only Google Ads and Taboola ads will be blocked.
I don't know all the URLs for advertising servers, so I will
need other people to contribute them.

I want to add the option to not block non-intrusive advertising,
but for now, I will not add this feature.

# Download Links
Download the files in this repo and compress them. Load the compressed
files into Chrome. In order for this extension to work, you must keep
developer mode on.
